## To use the Nix dev shell

1. [Install nix](https://determinate.systems/nix-installer/) and [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) if you don't already have them

2. Run `direnv allow` at the project root. If you don't want to use direnv, you can use `nix develop` to achieve the same thing, but you will need to run it every time you enter the project.
